## Question to raise intrigue ##
Have you ever been scared of walking home at night? 

## Some marketing stuff ##
BigBrother replaces campus initiatives such as WalkSmart giving you control of your location data. You can share your location with friends and allow them to monitor your walk. Our unique PIN system allows users to confirm their identity discreetly and quickly.

## Target demographic ##
Our target users are students concerned with their commutes late at night. 

## Future ##
In future updates, BigBrother will be able to send alerts to your friends and the authorities when you are in trouble.
